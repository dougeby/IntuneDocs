# Remove devices by using factory reset or remove company data

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

You can remove devices from Intune that are no longer needed, being repurposed, or missing. You can do this by using the **Remove company data** or **Factory reset** actions. Users can also issue a remote command from the Intune Company Portal to personally owned devices that are enrolled in Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you remove a user from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), use the **Factory reset** or **Remove company data** actions for all devices that are associated with that user. If you remove users that have managed devices from Azure AD, Intune can no longer issue a factory reset or remove company data for those devices.

## Factory reset

The **Factory reset** action restores a device to its factory default settings. A factory reset restores all company and user data and settings. The device is removed from Intune management. A factory reset is useful for resetting a device before you give the device to a new user, or when the device has been lost or stolen. Be careful about selecting **Factory reset**. Data on the device cannot be recovered.

### To factory reset a device

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All services** > **Intune**. Intune is located in the **Monitoring + Management** section.
3. In the **Devices** pane, select **All devices**.
4. Select the name of the device that you want to factory reset.
5. In the pane that shows the device name, select **Factory reset**.
6. For Windows 10 version 1709 or later, you also have the **Retain enrollment state and user account** option. 
    
    |Retained during a factory reset|Not retained|
    | -------------|------------|
    |User accounts associated with the device|User files|
    |Machine state \(domain join, Azure AD-joined)| User-installed apps \(store and Win32 apps)|
    |Mobile device management (MDM) enrollment|Non-default device settings|
    |OEM-installed apps \(store and Win32 apps)||
    |User profile||
    |User data outside of the user profile||
    |User autologon|| 
    
         
7. To confirm the factory reset, select **Yes**.

If the device is on and connected, the **Factory reset** action propagates across all device types in less than 15 minutes.

## Remove company data

The **Remove company data** action removes managed app data (where applicable), settings, and email profiles that were assigned by using Intune. **Remove company data** leaves the user's personal data on the device. The device is removed from Intune management. 

The following tables describe what data is removed, and the effect of the **Remove company data** action on data that remains on the device after company data is removed.

## Delete devices from the Azure Active Directory portal

You might need to delete devices from Azure AD due to communication issues or missing devices. You can use the **Delete** action to remove device records from the Azure portal for devices that you know are unreachable and unlikely to communicate with Azure again. The **Delete** action doesn't remove a device from management.

1.  Sign in to [Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal](http://aka.ms/accessaad) by using your admin credentials. You can also sign in to the [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com). From the menu, select **Admin centers** > **Azure AD**.
2.  Create an Azure subscription if you don’t have one. This shouldn't require a credit card or payment if you have a paid account (select the **Register your free Azure Active Directory** subscription link).
3.  Select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select your organization.
4.  Select the **Users** tab.
5. Select the user that's associated with the device that you want to delete.
6.  Select **Devices**.
7.  Remove devices as appropriate. For example, you might remove devices that are no longer in use, or devices that have inaccurate definitions.
