# UI updates for Intune end user apps
Learn what updates we've made to the UI for apps that your end users will see in this release of Microsoft Intune. This can help you with user communications and any updating custom documentation that you've created to support your deployment. It can also help you understand how to better troubleshoot any issues they're facing should they call helpdesk for support using the Company Portal.

### Easier to understand phrasing for the Company Portal app for Android <!---1396349--->  

The enrollment process for the Company Portal app for Android has been simplified with new text to make it easier for end users to enroll. If you have custom enrollment documentation, you will want to update it to reflect the new screens. You can find sample images on our [UI updates for Intune end user apps](whats-new-app-ui.md#week-of-september-11-2017) page.

### iOS 11 Mail app will support OAuth <!---1196951--->

Conditional access with Intune supports more secure authentication on iOS devices with OAuth. To support this, there will now be a different flow on the Company Portal app for iOS to allow for more secure authentication. When end users try to sign in to a new Exchange account in the Mail app, they will see a web view prompt. Upon enrollment in Intune, users will see a prompt to allow the native Mail app to access a certificate. Most end users will not see any more quarantined emails. Existing mail accounts will continue to use basic authentication protocol, so these users will still have quarantine emails delivered to them. This sign in experience for end users is similar to the one on Office mobile apps.

### Updates to the "Device Details" page on the Company Portal app for Windows 10 <!---1287448--->

The Company Portal app for Windows 10 is moving the __Category__ tag from below the title to a property on the __Device Details__ page.

![The Company Portal app for Windows' "Device Details" screen, which now shows the "Categories" field as a property rather than directly below the title of that screen.](./media/cp_win10_category_tag_move_after_1708.png)

### Apps details pages will display new information for Android devices <!--1287476-->

![The new app details page](./media/cp_android_appdetails_after_1708.png)

### Improved sign in experience across Company Portal apps for all platforms <!--User Story 1132123-->

We are announcing a change that is coming in the next few months that will improve the sign in experience for the Intune Company Portal apps for Android, iOS, and Windows. The new user experience will automatically appear across all platforms for the Company Portal app when Azure AD makes this change. In addition, users can now sign in to the Company Portal from another device with a generated, single-use code. This is especially useful in cases when users need to sign in without credentials.  

Below you can see the previous sign in experience, the new sign in experience with credentials, and the new sign in experience from another device.

### Company Portal app for Android now has a new end user experience for App Protection Policies <!--1305217-->
Based on customer feedback, we've modified the Company Portal app for Android to show an **Access Company Content** button. The intent is to prevent end users from unnecessarily going through the enrollment process when they only need to access apps that support App Protection Policies, a feature of Intune mobile application management.

The user will tap on the **Access Company Content** button instead of beginning to enroll the device.

![An image of the Android Company Portal app, which shows in large text "Access Company Content" in the middle rather than offering immediate enrollment options as is the standard case](./media/and_access_company_content_after_1706.png)

The user then is taken to the Company Portal website to authorize the app for use on their device, where the Company Portal website verifies their credentials.

![An image of the Company Portal website, confirming the sign in.](./media/and_iwp_sign_in_auth_page_after_1706.png)

The device can still be enrolled into full management by tapping on the **action** menu.

![An image of the Company Portal app for Android, showing the menu from the top right corner of the screen with an option to still enroll the device.](./media/and_sign_in_menu_after_app_protection_policy_enrolled_after_1706.png)

### Improvements to app syncing with Windows 10 Creators Update <!--676505-->

The Company Portal app for Windows 10 will now automatically initiate a sync for app install requests for devices with Windows 10 Creators Update (version 1703). This will reduce the issue of app installs stalling during the "Pending Sync" state. In addition, users will be able to manually initiate a sync from within the app.

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app, where the download of Microsoft Word is in a pending state from the Company Portal's app store.](./media/w10_download_pending_after_1706.png)

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app, with the new automatic syncing state showing with a status message indicating that the device is syncing and attempting to download the app.](./media/w10_download_pending_syncing_after_1706.png)

### New guided experience for Windows 10 Company Portal <!---1058938--->
The Company Portal app for Windows 10 will include a guided Intune walkthrough experience for devices that have not been identified or enrolled. The new experience provides step-by-step instructions that guide the user through registering into Azure Active Directory (required for Conditional Access features) and MDM enrollment (required for device management features). The guided experience will be accessible from the Company Portal home page. Users can continue to use the app if they do not complete registration and enrollment, but will experience limited functionality.

This update is only visible on devices running Windows 10 Anniversary Update (build 1607) or higher.

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app landing page, with a status message in the middle in the "devices" list which is telling a user that the device they're on hasn't been set up for corporate use yet, and that the user should select the message to begin setup.](./media/win10_guided_enroll_select_setup_after_1706.png)

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app set up page, which is warning the user that they need to add a corporate account to this device, then they can enroll it into management.](./media/win10_guided_enroll_we_help_setup_after_1706.png)

![An image of the Windows 10 Company Portal app add corporate account to this device page, which is telling the user that they will need to go to the Settings app and select "Connect" to complete enrollment.

### New menu action to easily remove Company Portal <!--1164569-->
Based on user feedback, the Company Portal app for Android has added a new menu action to initiate the removal of Company Portal from your device. This action removes the device from Intune management so that the app can be removed from the device by the user.

![An image of the Android Company Portal app, with the action menu opened in the top right corner. The new "remove company portal" option is available as the third option, underneath "my profile" and "settings", and above "terms and conditions", "help and feedback", and "about".](./media/android_remove_cp_menu_action_after_1705.png)

![An image of the confirmation dialog, that is available after selecting the new "remove company portal" option from the action menu. The dialog informs the user that "by removing company portal, your device will no longer be managed by your IT admin and may remove access to company data, company apps, and company email." It then asks the user to confirm that they want to remove the Company Portal app by selecting "Yes".](./media/android_remove_cp_menu_confirmation_after_1705.png)

### Sign-in progress indicator in Android Company Portal <!--953374-->

### Modernizing the Company Portal website <!--753980, announced 1701-->
Beginning in February, the Company Portal website will support apps that are targeted to users who do not have managed devices. The website will align with other Microsoft products and services by using a new contrasting color scheme, dynamic illustrations, and a "hamburger menu," ![Small image of the hamburger menu that is now added at the top left corner of the Company Portal website](./media/CP_hamburger_menu.png) which will contain helpdesk contact details and information on existing managed devices. The landing page will be rearranged to emphasize apps that are available to users, with carousels for Featured and Recently Updated apps.

![On the left, an image of the current version of the Company Portal website with its previous version of Apps, My Devices, and Featured and Categories views.
