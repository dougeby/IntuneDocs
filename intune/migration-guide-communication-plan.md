# Plan communications 

[!INCLUDE[note for both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

The communication plan is a key element in an Intune migration. You can follow the same communication plan for each phase as previously discussed under the Keys to a successful migration section.

## E-mail templates

Here’s an example on how you could communicate migration to your organization:

-   **Email \#1:** Explain benefits, expectations, and schedule. Take this opportunity to showcase any other new services whose access will be granted on Intune managed devices.

    -   [Download E-mail \#1 template to use in your organization](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Intune-migration-guide-end-e3209b35).
<br></br>

-   **Email \#2:** Announce that services are now ready for access through Intune. Tell users to enroll now. Remind users of benefits and strategic reasons for migration.

    -   [Download E-mail \#2 template to use in your organization.](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Intune-migration-guide-end-a9d25eb5)
<br></br>

-   **Email \#3:** Giving users timeline before access is impacted. Again, remind users of benefits and strategic reasons for migration. Email timing should have sliding window to match pipelining of phases. E.g. in June send email \#1 to Phase 1 users, email \#2 to phase 2 users and email \#1 to Phase 3 users.

After a certain period, you can begin enforcing compliance through conditional access policies and use it as criteria to access corporate data.

## Additional communication templates

Intune has additional template resources to promote device enrollment to end-users:

-   Refer to [How to educate your end users about Microsoft Intune](/intune/end-user-educate) for further guidance on enrollment steps per mobile OS platform
