# Plan communications

The communication plan is a key element in an Intune migration. You can follow the same communication plan for each phase of your migration.

## Email templates

We recommend the following email communication plan. We've provided templates for you to adapt for your communication plan:

-   **Email \#1:** Explain the benefits, expectations, and schedule. Take this opportunity to showcase any other new services whose access will be granted on devices managed by Intune.<br/>


    -   [Download email \#1 template](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Intune-migration-guide-end-e3209b35)
<br></br>

-   **Email \#2:** Announce that services are now ready for access through Intune. Tell users to enroll now. Remind users of benefits and strategic reasons for migration.<br/><br/>


    -   [Download email \#2 template](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Intune-migration-guide-end-a9d25eb5)
<br></br>

-   **Email \#3:** Give users a timeline before their access is affected. Again, remind users of benefits and strategic reasons for migration. Email timing should have a sliding window to match your phases. For example, in June send email \#1 to phase 1 users, email \#2 to phase 2 users, and email \#3 to phase 3 users.

After a certain period, you can begin enforcing compliance through conditional access policies and use it as criteria to access corporate data, as explained in [Drive end-user adoption with conditional access](migration-guide-drive-adoption.md).

## Additional communication templates

Intune has additional templates you can use to promote device enrollment with your users:

-   [How to educate your end users about Microsoft Intune](end-user-educate.md) breaks out enrollment steps by mobile OS platform.

-   The [Intune end-user enrollment template for IT administrators](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/End-user-Intune-enrollment-55dfd64a) is customizable Word doc that explains how to enroll Android, iOS, and Mac devices in Intune.
