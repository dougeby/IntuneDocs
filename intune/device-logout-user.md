[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]


The **Logout current user** action logs out the current user on a shared iPad device that has been configured to manage the iOS Classroom app with an [iOS education profile](education-settings-configure-ios.md). 

1.	Sign into the Azure portal.
2.	Choose **More Services** > **Monitoring + Management** > **Intune**.
3.	On the **Intune** blade, choose **Devices**.
4.	On the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **All devices**.
5.	From the list of devices you manage, choose an iOS device, and then choose the **Logout current user** device remote action.

## Next steps

To see the status of the action you just took, on the **Devices and groups** blade, choose **Device Actions**.
