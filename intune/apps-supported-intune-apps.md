# Microsoft Intune protected apps  

Intune-managed apps are enabled with a rich set of mobile application protection policies. Managed apps allow you to:
- Restrict copy-and-paste and save-as functions
- Configure web links to open inside the secure Microsoft browser
- Enable multi-identity use and app-level conditional access
- Intune-managed apps give you the choice to apply data loss prevention policies without managing the user's device. Enable app protection without requiring enrollment, or on devices managed with 3rd party EMM tools. 

Incorporate mobile app management in your mobile and line-of-business apps using the Intune App software development kit and app wrapping tool. 

The following tables provide a lists of support partner and Microsoft apps that are commonly used with Microsoft Intune.
