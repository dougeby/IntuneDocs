# Getting started with Intune in the Azure portal

The Azure portal is where you can find the Intune service. There's a lot of services in Azure, many of which you may not use on a regular basis. Customizing your dashboard and sidebar can help you find the right information quickly every time you log in to manage devices with Intune.

## Changing the sidebar

The __sidebar__ on the left side of the Azure portal shows you a list of all the available Azure services. This comprehensive list can be modified from its default view so that you can keep a persistent view of the services that matter most to you. We'll use Intune as the example of a service to add to the top of the list.

1. Select **More services** from the bottom of the sidebar on the left side of the page.
2. Search for **Intune** in the filter box.
3. Select the **star** to add Intune to the bottom of the list of your favorite services.
4. Hover over the Intune service. Select and drag Intune using the **three vertical dots** on the right side of the service name.

## Changing the dashboard

Your default landing page is the **dashboard**. This is where you'll customize your tiles to show information that is most relevant to you.

The dashboard modification buttons are along the top, with tiles that offer access to all resources, quickstart tutorials, service health, and Azure marketplace.](./media/azure-default-dashboard.png)

To modify your current dashboard, select the **Edit dashboard** button. If you don't want to change your default dashboard, you can also create a **New dashboard**. Creating a new dashboard gives you an empty, private dashboard with the **Tile Gallery**. This lets you add or rearrange tiles. You can find tiles by their **General** category, **Type**, through **Search**, and through a **Resource group** or **Tag**.

You can also add tiles directly to your dashboard from any **ellipsis** button and selecting **Pin to dashboard**.

This will be more relevant after you've added more content, like groups and users, to Intune.

## Using services

Whenever you open Intune or any other service in Azure, it will appear in a **blade**. Some of the first workloads you use in Intune, like **Users**, **Groups**, and **Mobile apps**, all appear in a full screen blade. When you select the workload, it will open that blade in the full page. Other blades will slide out from the right side of the blade when they open, and will collapse underneath the main blade that they came from.
