# Getting started with Microsoft Intune in the Azure portal

The Azure portal is where you can find the Microsoft Intune service. There are many services in Azure, many of which you may not use on a regular basis. Customizing your dashboard and sidebar within Azure can help you find the right information quickly every time you login to manage devices with Intune.

## Changing the sidebar

The __sidebar__ on the left side of the Azure portal shows you a list of all available Azure services. This comprehensive list can be changed from the default view so that you can keep a persistent view of the services that matter most to you. The information below uses Intune as the example of a service to add to the top of the list.

1. Select **All services** from the sidebar on the left side of the page.
2. Search for **Intune** in the filter box.
3. Select the **star** to add Intune to the bottom of the list of your favorite services.
4. Hover over the Intune service. Select and drag Intune using the **three vertical dots** on the right side of the service name.

## Changing the dashboard

Your default landing page is the **dashboard**. This page is where you customize your tiles to show information that is most relevant to you.

The dashboard modification buttons are along the top, with tiles that offer access to all resources, quickstart tutorials, service health, and Azure marketplace.](./media/azure-default-dashboard.png)

To modify your current dashboard, select the **Edit dashboard** button. If you don't want to change your default dashboard, you can also create a **New dashboard**. Creating a new dashboard gives you an empty, private dashboard with the **Tile Gallery**, which lets you add or rearrange tiles. You can find tiles by their **General** category, **Type**, through **Search**, and through a **Resource group** or **Tag**.

You can also add tiles directly to your dashboard from any **ellipsis** button and selecting **Pin to dashboard**.

This capability will be more relevant after you've added more content, like groups and users, to Intune.

## Using services

Whenever you open Intune or any other service in Azure, the service is displayed in a **pane**. Some of the first workloads you use in Intune, like **Users**, **Groups**, and **Mobile apps**, all appear in a full screen pane. When you select the workload, it opens that pane in the full page. Other panes slide out from the right side of the pane when they open, and collapse underneath the main pane that they came from.
