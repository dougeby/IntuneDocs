# Add app configuration policies for managed Android Enterprise devices

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Use app configuration policies in Microsoft Intune to supply settings to Managed Google Play apps on managed Android Enterprise devices. The app developer must expose Android managed app configuration settings as defined by the [AppConfig Community](https://www.appconfig.org/members) (opens 3rd party site) in order for Intune to specify configuration settings for the app. Assign the app configuration policy to the user group for which you want the settings to apply.  The policy settings are used when the app checks for them, typically the first time it is run.

> [!Note]  
> Not every app supports app configuration. Check with the app developer to see whether they have built their app to support app configuration policies.

1. Sign in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973).
3. Choose the **Client apps** workload.
4. Choose **App configuration policies** in the **Manage** group, and then choose **Add**.
5. Set the following details:
    - **Name** - The name of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Description** - The  description of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Device enrollment type** - Choose **Managed devices**.
6. Select **Android** for **Platform**.
7. Select **Associated App** to choose the app for which you want to define an app configuration policy. Select from the list of Managed Google Play apps that you have approved and synchronized with Intune.
8. Select **Permissions**. You can set configurations by using:
    - [Configuration designer](#use-the-configuration-designer)
    - [JSON editor](#enter-the-json-editor)
9. Choose **OK**, and then choose **Add**.

## Use the configuration designer

You can use the configuration designer for Managed Google Play apps when the app has been designed to support configuration settings. Configuration will apply on devices that are enrolled in Intune. The designer lets you configure specific configuration values for the settings than an app exposes.

Select **Add** to select the list of configuration settings that you want to specify for the app.  
For each key and value in the configuration, set:

- **Value type**  
  The data type of the configuration value. For String value types, you can optionally choose a variable or certificate profile as the value type.
- **Configuration value**  
  The value for the configuration. If you select variable or certificate for the value type, you can choose from a list of variables or certificate profiles in the configuration value dropdown.  If you choose a certificate, the certificate alias of the cert deployed to the device will be populated at runtime.

### Supported variables for configuration values

You can choose the following options if you choose variable as the value type:

| Option | Example |
|----|----|
| Mail | john@contoso.com |
| User Principal Name | john@contoso.com |
| Partial UPN | john |
| Domain | contoso.com |
| User name | John Doe |
| Account ID | fc0dc142-71d8-4b12-bbea-bae2a8514c81 |
| User ID | 3ec2c00f-b125-4519-acf0-302ac3761822 |
| Device ID | b9841cd9-9843-405f-be28-b2265c59ef97 |

### Allow only configured organization accounts in multi-identity apps 

For Android devices, use the following key/value pairs:

| **Key** | com.microsoft.intune.mam.AllowedAccountUPNs |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Values** | <ul><li>One or more <code>;</code> delimited UPNs.</li><li>Only account(s) allowed are the managed user account(s) defined by this key.</li><li> For Intune enrolled devices, the <code>{{userprincipalname}}</code> token may be used to represent the enrolled user account.</li></ul> |

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must use Outlook for Android 2.2.222 or later when allowing only configured organization accounts with multi-identity.<p></p>
   > As the Microsoft Intune admin, you can control which user accounts are added to Microsoft Office applications on managed devices. You can limit access to only allowed organization user accounts and block personal accounts on enrolled devices. The supporting applications process the app configuration and remove and block unapproved accounts.<p></p>
   > For Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, you must use app version 16.0.9327.1000 and later. 

## Enter the JSON editor

Some configuration settings on apps (such as those with Bundle types) cannot be configured with the configuration designer. You need to use the JSON editor for those values. Settings are supplied to apps automatically when the app is installed.

1. For **Configuration settings format**, select **Enter JSON editor**.
2. In the editor, you can define JSON values for configuration settings. You can choose **Download JSON template** to download a sample file that you can then configure.
3. Choose **OK**, and then choose **Add**.

The policy is created and appears on the policies list blade.

When the assigned app is run on a device, it runs with the settings that you configured in the app configuration policy.

## Preconfigure the permissions grant state for apps

You can also preconfigure permission for apps to access Android device features. By default, Android apps that require device permissions—such as access to location or the device camera—prompt users to accept or deny permissions. For example, if an app uses the device's microphone, the user is prompted to grant the app permission to use the microphone.

1. Sign in to [Intune](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2090973).
3. Choose **Client apps**.
3. Under **Manage**, choose **App configuration policies**, and then choose **Add**.
4. Set the following details:
    - **Name**. The name of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Description**. The  description of the profile that will appear in the Azure portal.
    - **Device enrollment type**. Select **Managed devices**.
    - **Platform**. Select **Android**.
5. Select **Associated App** to choose the app for which you want to define a configuration policy. Select from the list of Android work profile apps that you have approved and synchronized with Intune.
6. Select **Permissions** and then choose **Add**.
7. Select from the list of available app permissions and then choose **OK**.
8. Select an option for each permission to grant with this policy:
    - **Prompt**. Prompt the user to accept or deny.
    - **Auto grant**. Automatically approve without notifying the user.
    - **Auto deny**. Automatically deny without notifying the user.
9. To assign the app configuration policy, select the app configuration policy, select **Assignment**, and then select **Select groups**.
10. Select the user groups to assign, and then choose **Select**.
11. Choose **Save** to assign the policy.
