## Restricted apps

In the restricted apps list, you can configure one of the following lists:

A **Prohibited apps** list - List the apps (not managed by Intune) that users are not allowed to install and run.
An **Approved apps** list - List the apps that users are allowed to install. To remain compliant, users must not install apps that are not listed. Apps that are managed by Intune are automatically allowed.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the URL to the app in the app store.

### How to specify the URL to an app in the store

To specify an app URL in the apps list, use the following format:

Using a search engine, find the app that you want to use in the iTunes App Store and open the page for the app.
Copy the URL of the page and use this as the URL to configure the allowed or prohibited apps list or an app that you want to run in kiosk mode.
Device profiles that contain restricted app settings must be assigned to groups of users.

Example: Search for Microsoft Word for iPad. The URL that you use will be https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-word-for-ipad/id586447913?mt=8.

> [!Note]
> You can also use the iTunes software to find the app and then use the **Copy Link** command to get the app URL.



### Additional options

You can also click **Import** to populate the list from a csv file in the format <*app url*>, <*app name*>, <*app publisher*> or click **Export** to create a csv file containing the contents of the restricted apps list in the same format.

## Show or hide apps (supervised only)

In the show or hide apps list, you can configure one of the following lists (requires supervised devices running iOS 9.3 or later).

A **Hidden apps** list - Specify a list of apps that will be hidden from users. Users cannot view, or launch these apps.
An **Visible apps** list - Specify a list of apps that users can view and launch. No other apps can be viewed or launched.

To configure the list, click **Add**, then specify a name of your choice, optionally the app publisher, and the URL to the app in the app store.
