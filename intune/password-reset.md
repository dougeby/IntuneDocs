# Reduce help desk costs with self-service password reset

You can allow employees to reset work and school account passwords without help desk assistance. This type of self-service password reset is recommended in the following situations:
* Your company and school uses Azure Active Directory for work and school accounts.
* Your employees and students have internet access.
* You want to lower help desk costs.

## Action plan
