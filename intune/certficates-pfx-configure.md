# Configure and use PKCS certificates with Intune

Certificates authenticate and secure access to your corporate resources, such as a VPN or your WiFi network. Certificates that use a private key and a public  key, also known as PKCS certificates, are commonly used in many organizations. Microsoft Intune includes built-in features and settings to use PKCS certificates to secure access and authenticate users to your organizations resources. These settings are pushed (or deployed) to devices using device configuration profiles in Intune.

This article lists the requirements to use PKCS certificates, shows you how to export a PKCS certificate, and then add the certificate to an Intune device configuration profile.

## Requirements

To use PKCS certificates with Intune, be sure you have the following infrastructure:

- **Active Directory domain**: All servers listed in this section must be joined to your Active Directory domain.

  For more information about installing and configuring AD DS, see [AD DS Design and Planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/ad-ds-design-and-planning).

- **Certification Authority** (CA): An Enterprise Certification Authority (CA)

  For more information on installing and configuring Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), see [Active Directory Certificate Services Step-by-Step Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772393).

  > [!WARNING]
  > Intune requires you to run AD CS with an Enterprise Certification Authority (CA), not a Standalone CA.

- **A client**: To connect to the Enterprise CA

- **Root certificate**: An exported copy of your root certificate from your Enterprise CA

- **Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector**: Use the Azure portal to download the **Certificate Connector** installer (**NDESConnectorSetup.exe**). 

  The connector processes PKCS certificate requests used for authentication or S/MIME email signing.

  The NDES Certificate connector also supports Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode. FIPS is not required, but you can issue and revoke certificates when it's enabled.

- **PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune**: If you plan to use S/MIME email encryption, use the Azure portal to download the **PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune** installer (**PfxCertificateConnectorBootstrapper.exe**). The connector processes requests for PFX files imported in Intune for S/MIME email encryption for a specific user.

- **Windows Server**: Hosts the:

  - Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector (NDESConnectorSetup.exe) for authentication and S/MIME email signing scenarios
  - PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune (PfxCertificateConnectorBootstrapper.exe) for S/MIME email encryption scenarios.

  You can run both connectors (**Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector** and **PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune**) on the same server.

## Export the root certificate from the Enterprise CA

To authenticate with VPN, WiFi, or other resources, a root, or intermediate CA certificate is needed on each device. The following steps explain how to get the required certificate from your Enterprise CA.

1. Sign in to your Enterprise CA with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. Open a command prompt as an administrator.
3. Export the Root CA Certificate (.cer) to a location where you can access it later.
4. After the wizard completes, but before closing the wizard, click **Launch the Certificate Connector UI**.

   `certutil -ca.cert certnew.cer`

   For more information, see [Certutil tasks for managing certificates](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772898.aspx#BKMK_ret_sign).

## Configure certificate templates on the CA

1. Sign in to your Enterprise CA with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. Open the **Certification Authority** console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, and select **Manage**.
3. Find the **User** certificate template, right-click it, and choose **Duplicate Template**. **Properties of New Template** opens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For S/MIME email signing and encryption scenarios, many administrators use separate certificates for signing and encryption. If you're using Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services, you can use the **Exchange Signature Only** template for S/MIME email signing certificates, and the **Exchange User** template for S/MIME encryption certificates.  If you're using a 3rd party certification authority, it's suggested to review their guidance to set up signing and encryption templates.

4. On the **Compatibility** tab:

    - Set **Certification Authority** to **Windows Server 2008 R2**
    - Set **Certificate recipient** to **Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2**

5. On the **General** tab, set **Template display name** to something meaningful to you.

    > [!WARNING]
    > **Template name** by default is the same as **Template display name** with *no spaces*. Note the template name, you need it later.

6. In **Request Handling**, select **Allow private key to be exported**.
7. In **Cryptography**, confirm that the **Minimum key size** is set to 2048.
8. In **Subject Name**, choose **Supply in the request**.
9. In **Extensions**, confirm that you see Encrypting File System, Secure Email, and Client Authentication under **Application Policies**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > For iOS certificate templates, go to the **Extensions** tab, update **Key Usage**, and confirm that **Signature is proof of origin** isn't selected.

10. In **Security**, add the Computer Account for the server where you install the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector. Allow this account **Read** and **Enroll** permissions.
11. Select **Apply** > **OK** to save the certificate template. Close the **Certificate Templates Console**.
12. In the **Certification Authority** console, right-click **Certificate Templates** > **New** > **Certificate Template to Issue**. Choose the template that you created in the previous steps. Select **OK**.
13. For the server to manage certificates on behalf of Intune-enrolled devices and users, use the following steps:

    1. Right-click the Certification Authority, choose **Properties**.
    2. On the security tab, add the Computer account of the server where you run the connectors (**Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector** or **PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune**). Grant **Issue and Manage Certificates** and **Request Certificates** Allow permissions to the computer account.

14. Sign out of the Enterprise CA.

## Download, install, and configure the certificate connectors

### Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector **must** be installed on a separate Windows server. It can't be installed on the issuing Certificate Authority (CA).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **All services**, filter on **Intune** > select **Intune**.
2. Select **Device configuration** > **Certification Authority** > **Add**.
3. Download and save the connector file. Save it to a location accessible from the server where you're going to install the connector.

    ![ConnectorDownload][ConnectorDownload]

4. After the download completes, sign in to the server. Then:

    1. Be sure .NET 4.5 Framework or higher is installed, as it's required by the NDES Certificate connector. .NET 4.5 Framework is automatically included with Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer versions.
    2. Run the installer (NDESConnectorSetup.exe), and accept the default location. It installs the connector to `\Program Files\Microsoft Intune\NDESConnectorUI`. In Installer Options, select **PFX Distribution**. Continue and complete the installation.
    3. By default, the connector service runs under the local system account. If a proxy is required to access the internet, confirm that the local service account can access the proxy settings on the server.

5. The NDES Connector opens the **Enrollment** tab. To enable the connection to Intune, **Sign In**, and enter an account with global administrative permissions.
6. On the **Advanced** tab, it's recommended to leave **Use this computer's SYSTEM account (default)** selected.
7. **Apply** > **Close**
8. Go back to the Azure portal (**Intune** > **Device Configuration** > **Certification Authority**). After a few moments, a green check mark displays, and the **Connection status** is **Active**. Your connector server can now communicate with Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> TLS 1.2 support is included with the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector. So if the server with the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector installed supports TLS 1.2, then TLS 1.2 is used. If the server doesn't support TLS 1.2, then TLS 1.1 is used. Currently, TLS 1.1 is used for authentication between the devices and server.

### PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **All services**, filter on **Intune**, and select **Microsoft Intune**.
2. Select **Device configuration** > **Certification Authority** > **Add**
3. Download and save the PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune. Save it to a location accessible from the server where you're going to install the connector.
4. After the download completes, sign in to the server. Then:

    1. Be sure .NET 4.6 Framework or higher is installed, as it's required by the PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune. If .NET 4.6 Framework isn't installed, the installer installs it automatically.
    2. Run the installer (PfxCertificateConnectorBootstrapper.exe), and accept the default location. It installs the connector to `Program Files\Microsoft Intune\PFXCertificateConnector`.
    3. The connector service runs under the local system account. If a proxy is required for internet access, then confirm that the local service account can access the proxy settings on the server.

5. The PFX Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune opens the **Enrollment** tab after installation. To enable the connection to Intune, **Sign In**, and enter an account with Azure global administrator or Intune administrator permissions.
6. Close the window.
7. Go back to the Azure portal (**Intune** > **Device Configuration** > **Certification Authority**). After a few moments, a green check mark displays, and the **Connection status** is **Active**. Your connector server can now communicate with Intune.

## Create a trusted certificate profile

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Intune** > **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.

   ![NavigateIntune][NavigateIntune]

2. Enter the following properties:

    - **Name** for the profile
    - Optionally set a description
    - **Platform** to deploy the profile to
    - Set **Profile type** to **Trusted certificate**

3. Go to **Settings**, and enter the .cer file Root CA Certificate you previously exported.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Depending on the platform you chose in **Step 3**, you may or may not have an option to choose the **Destination store** for the certificate.

   ![ProfileSettings][ProfileSettings]

4. Select **OK** > **Create** to save your profile.
5. To assign the new profile to one or more devices, see [assign Microsoft Intune device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).

## Create a PKCS certificate profile

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Intune** > **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
2. Enter the following properties:

    - **Name** for the profile
    - Optionally set a description
    - **Platform** to deploy the profile to
    - Set **Profile type** to **PKCS certificate**

3. Go to **Settings**, and enter the following properties:

    - **Renewal threshold (%)**: Recommended is 20%.
    - **Certificate validity period**: If you didn't change the certificate template, this option may be set to one year.
    - **Key storage provider (KSP)**: For Windows, select where to store the keys on the device.
    - **Certification authority**: Displays the internal fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Enterprise CA.
    - **Certification authority name**: Lists the name of your Enterprise CA, such as "Contoso Certification Authority".
    - **Certificate template name**: The name of the template created earlier. Remember **Template name** by default is the same as **Template display name** with *no spaces*.
    - **Subject name format**: Set this option to **Common name** unless otherwise required.
    - **Subject alternative name**: Set this option to **User principal name (UPN)** unless otherwise required.

4. Select **OK** > **Create** to save your profile.
5. To assign the new profile to one or more devices, see [assign Microsoft Intune device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).

## Create a PKCS imported certificate profile

You can import certificates previously issued for a specific user from any certification authority to Intune. Imported certificates are installed on each device that a user enrolls. S/MIME email encryption is the most common scenario for importing existing PFX certificates in to Intune. A user may have multiple certificates to encrypt email. The private keys of those certificates must exist on all of a user's devices so they can decrypt previously encrypted email.

To import certificates into Intune, you can use the [PowerShell cmdlets provided on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Intune-Resource-Access).

After importing the certificates to Intune, create a **PKCS imported certificate** profile, and assign it to Azure Active Directory groups.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Intune** > **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
2. Enter the following properties:

    - **Name** for the profile
    - Optionally set a description
    - **Platform** to deploy the profile to
    - Set **Profile type** to **PKCS imported certificate**

3. Go to **Settings**, and enter the following properties:

    - **Intended purpose**: The intended purpose of the certificates that are imported for this profile. An administrator may have imported certificates with different intended purposes (such as authentication, S/MIME signing, or S/MIME encryption). The intended purpose selected in the certificate profile matches the certificate profile with the right imported certificates.
    - **Certificate validity period**: If you didn't change the certificate template, this option may be set to one year.
    - **Key storage provider (KSP)**: For Windows, select where to store the keys on the device.

4. Select **OK** > **Create** to save your profile.
5. To assign the new profile to one or more devices, see [assign Microsoft Intune device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).
