## Enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment

Automatic enrollment lets users enroll their Windows 10 devices in Intune. To enroll, users add their work account to their personally owned devices or join corporate-owned devices to Azure Active Directory. In the background, the device registers and joins Azure Active Directory. Once registered, the device is managed with Intune.

**Prerequisites**
- Azure Active Directory Premium subscription ([trial subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=816845))
- Microsoft Intune subscription


### Configure automatic MDM enrollment

4. Configure **MDM User scope**. Specify which users’ devices should be managed by Microsoft Intune. These Windows 10 devices can automatically enroll for management with Microsoft Intune.

  - **None** - MDM automatic enrollment disabled
  - **Some** - Select the **Groups** that can automatically enroll their Windows 10 devices
  - **All** - All users can automatically enroll their Windows 10 devices

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If both **MAM user scope** and automatic MDM enrollment (**MDM user scope**) are enabled for a group, only MAM is enabled. Only MAM is added for users in that group when they workplace join personal device. Devices are not automatically MDM enrolled.

5. Use the default values for the following URLs:
    - **MDM Terms of use URL**
    - **MDM Discovery URL**
    - **MDM Compliance URL**

6. Select **Save**.

By default, two-factor authentication is not enabled for the service. However, two-factor authentication is recommended when registering a device. To enable two-factor authentication, configure a two-factor authentication provider in Azure AD and configure your user accounts for multi-factor authentication. See [Getting started with the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-cloud).
