## Enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment

Automatic enrollment lets users enroll their Windows 10 devices in Intune when adding their work account to their personally-owned devices or joining their corporate-owned devices to your Azure Active Directory. In the background, the user's device registers and joins Azure Active Directory. Once registered, the device is managed with Intune.

**Prerequisites**
- Azure Active Directory Premium subscription ([trial subscription](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=816845))
- Microsoft Intune subscription


### Configure automatic MDM enrollment

5. Use the default values for the following URLs:
    - **MDM Terms of use URL**
    - **MDM Discovery URL**
    - **MDM Compliance URL**

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you configure both **MDM URLs** and **MAM URLs**, and users try to workplace join their personal devices, then only MAM is enabled. Devices are not MDM enrolled. 

6. Select **Save**.

By default, two-factor authentication is not enabled for the service. However, two-factor authentication is recommended when registering a device. Before requiring two-factor authentication for this service, you must configure a two-factor authentication provider in Azure Active Directory and configure your user accounts for multi-factor authentication. See [Getting started with the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-cloud).
