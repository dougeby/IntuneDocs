# Email profile settings in Microsoft Intune for devices running Windows Phone 8.1

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article shows you the email profile settings you can configure for your devices running Windows Phone 8.1.


- **Apply all settings to Windows Phone 8.1 only** - This is a setting you can configure in the Intune classic portal. In the Azure portal, this setting cannot be changed. If this is set to **Configured**, any setting is only applied to Windows Phone 8.1 devices. If set to **Not Configured**, these settings also apply to Windows 10 Mobile devices.
- **Email server** - The host name of your Exchange server.
- **Account name** - The display name for the email account as it appears to users on their devices.
- **Username attribute from AAD** - This is the attribute in Active Directory (AD) or Azure AD, that is used to generate the username for this email profile. Select **Primary SMTP Address**, such as **user1@contoso.com** or **User Principal Name**, such as **user1** or **user1@contoso.com**.
- **Email address attribute from AAD** - How the email address for the user on each device is generated. Select **Primary SMTP Address** to use the primary SMTP address to log into Exchange or use **User Principal Name** to use the full principal name as the email address.


## Security settings

- **SSL** - Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) communication when sending emails, receiving emails, and communicating with the Exchange server.



## Synchronization settings

- **Amount of email to synchronize** - Choose the number of days of email that you want to synchronize, or select **Unlimited** to synchronize all available email.
- **Sync schedule** - Select the schedule by which devices synchronize data from the Exchange server. You can also select **As Messages arrive**, which synchronizes data as soon as it arrives, or **Manual**, where the user of the device must initiate the synchronization.

## Content sync settings

- **Content type to sync** - Select the content types that you want to synchronize to devices from:
	- **Contacts**
	- **Calendar**
	- **Tasks**
