# Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10 (and later) in Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

The endpoint protection profile lets you control security features on Windows 10 devices, like BitLocker and Windows Defender.

Use the information in this article to create endpoint protection profiles. To configure Windows Defender Antivirus, see [Windows 10 Device Restrictions](device-restrictions-windows-10.md#windows-defender-antivirus). 

## Windows Defender Application Guard

Supported on the following Windows 10 editions:

- Enterprise 
- Professional

While using Microsoft Edge, Windows Defender Application Guard protects your environment from sites that aren't trusted by your organization. When users visit sites that aren’t listed in your isolated network boundary, the sites are opened in a Hyper-V virtual browsing session. Trusted sites are defined by a network boundary, which can be configured in Device Configuration.

Application Guard is only available for Windows 10 (64-bit) devices. Using this profile installs a Win32 component to activate Application Guard.

- **Application Guard**: **Enable** to turn on this feature, which opens unapproved sites in a Hyper-V virtualized browsing container. **Not configured** (default) means that any site (approved and unapproved) opens on the device.
- **Clipboard behavior**: Choose what copy/paste actions are allowed between the local PC and the Application Guard virtual browser.
- **External content on enterprise sites**: **Block** content from unapproved websites from loading. **Not configured** (default) means that non-enterprise sites can open on the device.
- **Print from virtual browser**: **Allow** to allow PDF, XPS, local, and/or network printers to print content from the virtual browser. **Not configured** (default) disables all print features.
- **Collect logs**: **Allow** to collect logs for events that occur within an Application Guard browsing session. **Not configured** (default) doesn't collect any logs within the browsing session.
- **Retain user-generated browser data**: **Allow** saves user data (such as passwords, favorites, and cookies) that is created during an Application Guard virtual browsing session. **Not configured** (default) discards user-downloaded files and data when the device restarts, or when a user signs out.
- **Graphics acceleration**: **Enable** to load graphic-intensive websites and video faster by getting access to a virtual graphics processing unit. **Not configured** (default) uses the device's CPU for graphics; it doesn't use the virtual graphics processing unit.
- **Download files to host file system**: **Enable** so users download files from the virtualized browser onto the host operating system. **Not configured** (default) keeps the files local on the device, and doesn't download files to the host file system.

## Windows Defender Firewall

Supported on the following Windows 10 editions:
- Home
- Professional
- Business
- Enterprise
- Education
- Mobile
- Mobile Enterprise

### Global settings

These settings are applicable to all network types.

- **File Transfer Protocol**: **Block** to disable stateful FTP. When **Not configured** (default), the firewall does stateful FTP filtering to allow secondary connections.
- **Security association idle time before deletion**: Security associations are deleted after no network traffic is detected for *n* seconds. Enter an idle time in seconds.
- **Pre-shared key encoding**: **Enable** to use preshared key encoding using UTF-8. **Not configured** (default) uses the local store value.
- **IPsec exemptions**: Configure specific traffic to be exempt from IPsec, including:
  - **Neighbor discover IPv6 ICMP type-codes**
  - **ICMP**
  - **Router discover IPv6 ICMP type-codes**
  - **Both IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP network traffic**
- **Certificate revocation list verification**: Determine how certificate revocation list verification is enforced, including **Disable CRL verification**, **Fail CRL verification on revoked certificate only**, and **Fail CRL verification on any error encountered**.
- **Opportunistically match authentication set per keying module**: **Enable** so keying modules MUST ignore only the authentication suites that they don’t support. When **Not configured**, keying modules MUST ignore the entire authentication set if they don't support all of the authentication suites specified in the set.
- **Packet queuing**: Enter how software scaling on the receive side is enabled for the encrypted receive and clear text forward for the IPsec tunnel gateway scenario. This setting ensures that packet order is preserved.

### Network settings

These settings are applicable to specific network types, including **Domain (workplace) network**, **Private (discoverable) network**, and **Public (non-discoverable) network**.

#### General settings

- **Windows Defender Firewall**: **Enable** to turn on the firewall, and advanced security. **Not configured** (default) allows all network traffic, regardless of any other policy settings.

Use [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/windows-defender-exploit-guard) to manage and reduce the attack surface of apps used by your employees.

### Attack Surface Reduction

- **Flag credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem**

  Help [prevent actions and apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines.

#### Rules to prevent Office Macro threats

Block Office apps from taking the following actions:

- **Office apps injecting into other processes (no exceptions)**
- **Office apps/macros creating executable content**
- **Office apps launching child processes**
- **Win32 imports from Office macro code**

#### Rules to prevent script threats

Block the following to help prevent against script threats:

- **Obfuscated js/vbs/ps/macro code**
- **js/vbs executing payload downloaded from Internet (no exceptions)**
- **Process creation from PSExec and WMI commands**
- **Untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB**
- **Executables that don’t meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criteria**

#### Rules to prevent email threats

Block the following to help prevent email threats:

- **Execution of executable content (exe, dll, ps, js, vbs, etc.) dropped from email (webmail/mail client) (no exceptions)**

#### Rules to protect against Ransomware
- **Advanced ransomware protection**

> [!TIP]
> [Reduce attack surfaces with Windows Defender Exploit Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard) provides more details on these rules.

#### Attack Surface Reduction exceptions

- **Files and folder to exclude from attack surface reduction rules**: Import/add a list of locations to exclude from the configured rules.

### Controlled folder access

Help protect valuable data from malicious apps and threats, such as ransomware.

- **Folder protection**: Protect files and folders from unwanted changes by malicious apps. You can import a **List of apps that have access to protected folders** or add them manually. You can also add a **List of additional folders that need to be protected** with an upload or adding them manually.

### Network filtering

Block outbound connections from any app to low reputation IP/domains.

### Exploit protection

To enable exploit protection, create an XML file that includes the system and application mitigation settings you want. There are two methods:

 1. PowerShell: Use one or more of the Get-ProcessMitigation, Set-ProcessMitigation, and ConvertTo-ProcessMitigationPolicy PowerShell cmdlets. The cmdlets configure mitigation settings, and export an XML representation of them.

 2. Windows Defender Security Center UI: In the Windows Defender Security Center, click on App & browser control and then scroll to the bottom of the resulting screen to find Exploit Protection. First, use the System settings and Program settings tabs to configure mitigation settings. Then, find the Export settings link at the bottom of the screen to export an XML representation of them.

Block **User editing of the exploit protection interface** by uploading an XML file that allows you to configure memory, control flow, and policy restrictions. The settings in the XML file can be used to block an application from exploits. **Not configured** (default) doesn't push out a custom configuration.

When **Not configured** or enabled (default), the Microsoft network client asks the server to run SMB packet signing upon session setup. If packet signing is enabled on the server, packet signing is negotiated. If set to **Disable**, the SMB client never negotiates SMB packet signing.
- **Send unencrypted password to third-party SMB servers**: When set to **Enable**, the Server Message Block (SMB) redirector can send plaintext passwords to non-Microsoft SMB servers that don't support password encryption during authentication. When **Not configured** (default), the passwords are encrypted.

### Microsoft Network Server

- **Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)**: Determines if the SMB server negotiates SMB packet signing with clients that request it. When set to **Enable**, the Microsoft network server negotiates SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing is enabled on the client, packet signing is negotiated. When **Not configured** or disabled (default), the SMB client never negotiates SMB packet signing.
- **Digitally sign communications (always)**: Determines if packet signing is required by the SMB server component. When set to **Enable**, the Microsoft network server doesn't communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to SMB packet signing. When **Not configured** or disabled (default), SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.
