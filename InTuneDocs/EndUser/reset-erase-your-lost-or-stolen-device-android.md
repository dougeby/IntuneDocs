# Check compliance on your Android device

If your device hasn't checked in with Intune in a while, you might not be able to access your company or school resources. To regain access, try the following:

1. Open the Android Company Portal app on your device.

2. 

If you are unable to reset your lost or stolen device, ask your IT administrator to reset it for you. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
