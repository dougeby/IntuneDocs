# Device doesn't have the required minimum operating system version

Your Windows device doesn’t meet the minimum operating system version that your IT department requires. Before you update your mobile device, check the current operating system version by choosing **Settings** &gt; **about**. Then, to update your device, choose **Settings** &gt; **phone update** &gt; **check for updates**.

Before you update your computer, search for **operating system** and follow the prompts to identify your current operating system version. To update computers that have operating systems earlier than Windows 10, search for **Windows updates**.

To check the version for Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, select the Windows logo key + R, type **winver** in the dialog box, and select Enter.

- For Windows 10, ignore the version number and look at the OS build number (example: OS Build 10586.29). The "10" in 10586.29 stands for Windows 10.
- For Windows 8.1, look at the version number. It will show 6.3.*xxxx* instead of 8.1.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
