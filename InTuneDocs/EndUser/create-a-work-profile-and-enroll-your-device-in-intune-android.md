# Create a work profile and enroll your device in Intune

A work profile is something that you set up on your device to enable you to access your work or school email, apps, and files. You can find out more about [what happens when you create a work profile](what-happens-when-you-create-a-work-profile-android.md).

To create a work profile:

1.  On the Android Company Portal **Welcome** screen, tap **Sign in**, and then sign in with your work or school account. If you haven't installed the free app yet, download and install it from [Google Play](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal).

2. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, tap **BEGIN**.

3.  On the **Why create a work profile?** screen, read about what you'll be able to do, and then tap **CONTINUE**.

4.  Review a list of what your IT administrator can and can't see on your device, and tap **CONTINUE**.

5.  On the **What comes next** screen, read about what's going to happen next, and then tap **ENROLL**.

6. On the **Set up work profile** screen, tap **NEXT** to let the Company Portal app access the work profile.

7. Review the Google screen that describes what your IT administrator can do when you create a work profile, and then tap **OK**.

	![Review Google's information about work profiles](./media/andr-afw-google-screen-what-it-can-do.png)

	You'll see a couple of messages that say "Setting up your work profile" and "Enrolling your device."

8. On the **You're Halfway There!** screen, tap the Company Portal app icon that has the badge on it.

	![Tap the Company Portal app with the badge](./media/andr-afw-tap-work-badged-company-portal-icon2.png)

10. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, note that your Work Profile Setup is now complete, and then tap **CONTINUE**.
