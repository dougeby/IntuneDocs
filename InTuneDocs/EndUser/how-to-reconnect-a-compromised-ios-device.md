# How to reconnect a compromised iOS device
Your IT admin detected that you are using a jailbroken device. "Jailbroken" means that software restrictions, imposed by iOS, have been removed, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources, and you must contact your IT administrator for help. For IT administrator contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
