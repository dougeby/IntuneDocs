# How to reconnect a compromised iOS device
Your IT admin detected that you are using a jailbroken device. "Jailbroken" means that software restrictions, imposed by iOS, have been removed, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources. When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources and must contact your IT administrator for help. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
