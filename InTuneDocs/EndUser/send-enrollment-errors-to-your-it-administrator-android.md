# Send enrollment errors to your IT admin

If you get an error while trying to enroll your Android device in Intune, you can try enrolling again by tapping **Retry**. You can also send the error information to your IT admin in an email by tapping **Send info**.

Tapping **Send info** automatically creates an email addressed to your IT admin that contains the logs your IT admin needs to help troubleshoot your device.

There are different ways you can send your device's data logs to your IT admin to get help with errors:

- [Use a USB cable to send logs](send-diagnostic-data-logs-to-your-it-administrator-using-a-usb-cable-android.md)
- [Use email to send logs](send-diagnostic-data-logs-to-your-it-administrator-using-email-android.md)
