# Password does not meet IT administrator requirements

The password that you use to access your company or school resources does not meet one or more requirements that your IT admin has set up. Depending on how many requirements your IT admin set up, you might be several of the following issues:

- **Password does not contain complex characters**. Your IT admin requires you to use complex characters in your password. Examples of complex characters might be numbers, capital letters, and symbols like $, %, and #. 

- **Password is too simple and not secure enough**. Examples of simple passwords might be 1234 or 1111. If you're not sure what kinds of passwords are allowed, try making sure that your password doesn't contain sequential or repeating numbers, like the ones in the example.

- **Password has expired**. Your password has expired, so you must set a new one that meets the requirements set by your IT admin.

- **Password is not set**. Before you can access work email and data on your device, you must set a password that meets the requirements set by your IT admin.

- **Password is too short**. Your IT admin requires you to use a longer password with more characters.

- **Your password was used too recently**. Your IT admin is preventing you from using previous passwords that you've used in the past. Choose a password that you haven't used before. 

- **Password isn't complex enough to meet requirements**. Your IT admin requires you to use more complex characters in your password. Try using characters like numbers, capital letters, and symbols like $, %, and #. 

For information about setting your PIN or password, or for information about other tasks that you can do with your device, use the link that matches the type of device you have:

- [Set your Android device PIN or password](set-your-pin-or-password-android.md)
- [Set or change your iOS device passcode](set-or-change-your-passcode-ios.md)
- [Set or change your Windows device password](set-or-change-your-password-windows.md)

If you have trouble figuring out how to make your password comply with the requirements, contact your IT administrator. For their contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
