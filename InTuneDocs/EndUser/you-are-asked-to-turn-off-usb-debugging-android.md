# You are prompted to turn off USB debugging

If you see the message, “USB debugging must be disabled,” you need to go to **Settings** > **Developer options**, and turn off **USB debugging**.

Your IT administrator requires this setting to be turned off to protect the corporate data on your Android device.

If **USB debugging** is turned on, your device data is less safe when you have a USB device connected.

Once you turn off **USB debugging**, it may take a few minutes before you can continue to use your Android device to access company or school data.

Still need help? Contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
