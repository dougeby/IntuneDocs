# Send diagnostic data logs to your IT admin using email

If you get an error on your Android device while you're working with your school or company apps or while you're in the Company Portal app, you can send diagnostic data logs to help your IT admin diagnose and fix the error. To include all details in the logs, which will make it easier for your IT admin to figure out the issue, turn on verbose logging. For more about verbose logging see [Use verbose logging to help your IT administrator fix device issues android](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).

To send logs to your IT admin using email:

1.  Open the Company Portal app.

2.  Tap **Menu** &gt;  **Help and Feedback**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on the type of Android device you have.

3.  Under **Help**, tap **Get Help**.

If you have questions, contact your IT administrator. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com).
