# Set or change your passcode

If your Windows device doesn't comply with your IT admin's password policy, a message appears that briefly describes the issue and explains what you need to do to make your password meet the requirements.

Your IT admin can set more than one password requirement. For example, the password might have to be a certain number of characters, and it might have to be a mix of numbers and letters. Because more than one requirement might be set, these instructions explain only how to set or change your password. They don't explain every possible combination of requirements.

If you have trouble setting a password that meets all of the password requirements, contact your IT admin for help.
