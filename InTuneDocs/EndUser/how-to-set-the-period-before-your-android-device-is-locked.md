To reconnect to your work, you’ll need to set the password timeout on your device by following the steps for the type of device you have.

## Native (non-Samsung KNOX) device

1.  In **Settings** on your device, tap **Security** &gt; **Automatically Lock** (this appears as **Lock phone after** on some devices).

    If **Automatically Lock** (**Lock phone after** on some devices) is not displayed, ensure that you have set a valid password under **Settings** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.

2.  Select the password timeout value.

## Samsung KNOX device

    If **Lock automatically Lock** (**Lock phone after** on some devices) is not displayed, ensure that you have set a valid password under **Settings** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.
