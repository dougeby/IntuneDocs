# What happens if you unenroll your Android device from Intune?

When you unenroll your Android device from Intune:

-   Your IT admin doesn’t manage the device anymore.

-	You lose access to company data and resources.

-   Your device doesn’t appear in the Company Portal anymore.

-   You can’t install apps from the Company Portal anymore.

-   Any settings that were changed on your device when you added it (for example, disabling the camera or requiring a certain password length) no longer apply.

If your device is set up only to get company email, and you unenroll your device, your device won't appear in the Company Portal anymore.

For instructions on how to unenroll, see [Unenroll your device from Intune by using the Company Portal app](unenroll-your-device-from-intune-android.md).

Need help? Contact your IT admin (check the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com) for contact information), or write the Microsoft Android team at wintunedroidfbk@microsoft.com.
