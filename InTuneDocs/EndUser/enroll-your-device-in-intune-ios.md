# Enroll your iOS device in Intune

If your company or school uses Microsoft Intune, you can enroll your iOS device to get access to company email, files, and other resources. When you enroll your devices, your IT department can manage those work or school resources, keep them secure, and give you the freedom to use your preferred device to get your work done. To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md).

If you're trying to enroll a Mac OS X device, see [Enroll your Mac OS X device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-intune-mac-os-x.md).

**Before you start:**

- Make sure that you finish enrolling after you start the steps. If you start but don't finish, enrollment may not work if you come back later and try again.
- Make sure that your Wi-Fi is working. Otherwise, enrollment will fail.
- If you blocked Safari on your device, unblock it. You must use Safari to enroll.


**To enroll your iOS device:**

1.  Follow the steps in [Install and sign in to the Intune Company Portal app](install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios.md).

2. On the **Company Access Setup** page, tap **Begin**.

12. On the **Company Access Setup** screen, tap **Continue**.
