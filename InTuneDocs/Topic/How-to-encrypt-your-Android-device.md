# How to encrypt your Android device
To reconnect to your work, you’ll need to encrypt your device by following these instructions:

1.  Ensure that your device is connected to the charger.

2.  Ensure that a screen lock PIN or password has been set for your device.

3.  In **Settings** on your device, click **Security** &gt; **Encrypt Phone**.

    (On some phones, you’ll need to click **Storage** &gt; **Storage encryption**)

4.  Follow the on-screen instructions. During encryption, your device might restart several times.

5.  Ensure that your device is enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] by following the instructions in [Enroll your device to use it at work](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=519071).
