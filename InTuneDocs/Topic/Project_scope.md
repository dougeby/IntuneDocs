# Project scope
In the project scope phase, you will outline your goals, timeline and success metrics, define key organizational readiness factors, assemble your project team, and begin initial preparations for all phases involved with successfully rolling out [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] across your organization and ensuring a great experience for end users.
Invest the right time and effort to define what long-term success looks like so that your plan reflects all the right steps along the way to achieve that vision. While there is always opportunity to fine tune along the way, having a comprehensive readiness plan that's tightly aligned with the core technical deployment is a key factor to overall success.

## Why is this important?
Change management often presents the biggest obstacle when rolling out new technology. Driving positive change involves careful planning, from the very first messaging about what's coming to users' first experience and through the entire adoption cycle. Utilization is the key to realizing the full impact of your investment and end users are the key to achieving successful utilization.
Begin by reviewing the discovery questions below to help scope and define your rollout project

## Discovery questions
Discuss these questions with your project team to help scope your project details, uncover potential risks, and define actionable tasks which can be documented in the  Rollout Planning Guide and Project Plan.

-   What are the core drivers behind your organization's decision to deploy [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]?

-   What is the scope of your deployment (number of users, devices)?
    What is your timeline for completing this rollout?

-   What are your most important goals to indicate a successful rollout and how will you measure success?

-   Who are your core user groups and how will you organize around them (by role, by line of business, by subsidiary, by location, other)?

-   Can you identify users or groups that could be early adopters or key influencers to support the rollout?

-   How big a change does this present for your organization and user communities?

-   What are the expected benefits and pain points relative to this change?

-   Do you have any current blockers or challenges that should be accounted for?

-   Who makes up your core, accountable rollout project team?

-   Who is the executive sponsor, funding this project and driving core messaging?

## Focus area goals
Review this section for guidance on focus-area activities for this stated phase of your rollout.

### Planning
Goals
The majority of your efforts in the Scope phase revolve around planning and preparation. When scoping your rolling project, consider both technology and organizational issues, as well as how users work today and the behavior change required. Start with your "big picture" end goal in mind, then create smaller goals in subsequent phases to stay on track.

### Help desk
In order for knowledge workers to benefit from a productive [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] experience, the Help Desk should be well-prepared. As you scope your project, consider how help desk will play a part in each phase, and what resources you will need to execute and ensure your help desk is ready to support end users.

### Awareness
A well-defined awareness campaign is essential for driving change and sustained adoption. While defining your project scope, consider your target audiences for each phase and what messaging is required. Begin identifying resources from your marketing and communications teams, as well as any potential budget you may need to help execute the plan.

### Training
Instilling end-user confidence in using a new solution is a key component in supporting long term usage and adoption. As with awareness, understanding training needs for each phase of our rollout, will help ensure a successful execution and adoption from your end-user.

### Operations
Now is the time to outline your long-term plan. Scoping your operations plan includes understanding how you will manage, support and ensure both your technical aspects and user readiness aspects stay up-to-date, and that your goals continue to be met.

## Get started checklist
Here is a list of steps to get you started with the **Project scope** phase.

-   Develop clearly articulated goals, success criteria, and a timeline, and account for potential risks or blockers.

-   Assemble a rollout planning team comprised of coordinated work streams to focus on core technical, change management, end-user experience, and operational focus areas, across all phases.

-   Incorporate the needs of key stakeholders, as well as end users when developing your timeline and top-line messaging.

-   Identify any considerations/risks/mitigations that may impact your project.

-   Finalize your project plan

-   Obtain approval of plan from key stakeholders.

## Common challenges
Here are some  challenges that you may encounter in the **Project scope** phase.

-   **Challenge:** Organizational readiness and end-user experience is an afterthought or not considered in initial project scope. Organization takes a "deploy it and they will come" approach, resulting in poor usage and adoption.

    **Mitigation:** Begin your rollout and adoption planning from day one, in conjunction with your technical deployment efforts.

-   **Challenge:** Lack of clearly defined goals and success metrics result in intangible results, as well as reactive mode once issues arise:

    **Mitigation:** Define your goals and metrics early in your project scope, and use these data points to flesh out your other rollout phases. Make sure goals are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely) and plan to measure against your goals at each phase and plan to ensure your rollout project stays on track.

-   **Challenge:** Neglecting to create, validate, and aggressively share a clear value prop that resonates for your organization, often results in limited adoption and lack of ROI.

    **Mitigation:** While you may be excited to jump into your project, ensure you have a clearly-defined value message. Include this value messaging in all awareness and training activities to help ensure users understand why your organization selected [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].
