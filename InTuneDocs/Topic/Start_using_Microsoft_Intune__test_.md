## Start with a free trial
Use the [Start with a 30-day trial](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646967.aspx%20) guidance to get your trial version of Intune set up quickly. The free trial allows you to test up to 100 user licenses and comes with free support.

> [!NOTE]
> If you sign up for a new account, you cannot use an existing work or school account later to manage that account, or combine it with existing volume licensing agreements.

So, [ sign up for a new account](https://account.manage.microsoft.com/Signup/MainSignUp.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&ali=1) if:

-   Your organization doesn’t already have an Enterprise Agreement, a Microsoft volume licensing agreement, or an Office 365 subscription.

    OR

-   You will discard your free trial after evaluating Intune. This is recommended if you plan to use Intune with System Center 2012 Configuration Manager.

## Start with your paid subscription
If you have a work or school account with an Enterprise Agreement or equivalent volume licensing agreement or Office 365 subscription, [sign in with your work or school account ](https://manage.microsoft.com/) and use the [Start with a paid subscription](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646983.aspx) guidance to quickly set up a small deployment so you can begin testing out device management scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are setting up Intune on an existing account, we recommend that you review [introduction to Intune](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646960.aspx).

## What to tell employees about Intune
We've compiled [a list of topics](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn948527(TechNet.10).aspx) to help you answer end-user questions and troubleshoot end-user devices managed by Intune. And you can download the  customizable [end-user enrollment guide](http://aka.ms/bm3ml2) to distribute to your employees.

## What’s new
The Intune service is updated regularly and significant changes are documented in the [What's new](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn292747.aspx) topic, which you can also find from the Intune dashboard.

## How to get help for Intune
With every Microsoft Intune subscription, Microsoft Support provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support. [Support is available both online and by telephone for both paid and trial subscriptions](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646963.aspx).

If your company has more than 150 Intune licenses, and you're looking for help with Intune deployment, consider signing up for the [Intune Onboarding benefit](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt228265.aspx).
