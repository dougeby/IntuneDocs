# Cancel my subscription for Microsoft Intune
You can cancel your [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] subscription:

-   At the end of your term

-   Before the end of your term

You can’t:

-   Cancel a trial subscription

-   Get a refund for subscriptions purchased with a product key. For more information, see [Subscriptions with different cancellation methods](../Topic/Cancel_my_subscription_for_Microsoft_Intune.md#BKMK_CancelMethods).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you canceled using expedited deprovisioning, your data will be deleted within 3 days. Expedited deprovisioning allows you to cancel your subscription and delete all of the data associated with it without waiting the usual 90 days for your data to be deleted from the system. To use expedited deprovisioning, call Support.

### <a name="BKMK_CancelAtEnd"></a>Cancel at the end of your term
You can cancel at the end of your term by turning off auto-renew:

1.  Sign in to [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] with your work or school account.

2.  Go to the [!INCLUDE[wit_icp_1](../Token/wit_icp_1_md.md)].

3.  Select **Subscriptions** &gt; **Manage**.

4.  On the **Subscription details** page, click a subscription, and then click **Turn auto-renew off**. At the end of your term, the subscription will expire and you will no longer be billed.

If you bought your subscription through the Open or FPP channels, it will already expire at the end of your term and you don't need to cancel in another way.

### <a name="BKMK_CancelBeforeEnd"></a>Cancel before the end of your term
> [!NOTE]
> Note: If you cancel before the end of your term, you may be subject to early termination fees.

|**1. Remove domains**|If you added your own domain name to use with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], you must [remove the domain](https://support.office.com/article/remove-the-domain-f09696b2-8c29-4588-a08b-b333da19810c).

|**2. Backup data**|You lose access to your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] data when your cancellation becomes effective, so save your files to another location before you go. Any data that you leave behind is permanently deleted 90 days after cancellation.|
