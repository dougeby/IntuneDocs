# Quick Start Guide: Quickly protect Windows PCs against malware threats
Microsoft Intune can help you quickly protect and monitor your managed Windows PCs against malware threats using the Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection agent or through Windows Defender URI settings for Windows 10 PCs enrolled as devices.

## Is this quick start guide right for you?
Do you need to protect Windows PCs against malware threats or do you have to move to a different antimalware solution from the one you’ve been using?

If yes, you can quickly protect Windows PCs against malware threats by deploying and configuring the Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection agent. Once the agent is installed, Microsoft Intune enables real-time monitoring for malware threats and enables follow-up actions to be taken on malware infected PCs like remotely initiating malware protection scans.

Alternatively, you can help protect Windows 10 PCs enrolled as devices through the Open Mobile Alliance Device Management (OMA DM) protocol and custom URI settings for Windows 10 devices.
