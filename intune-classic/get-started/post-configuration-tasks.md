After you complete the initial configuration steps for an Intune  paid subscription, you should consider enabling additional mobile device management functionality.

-   **Connect Exchange to Intune:** For users with mobile devices  that haven't  enrolled in Intune, you can enable Exchange ActiveSync management using a connector for on-premises Exchange and for Exchange Online in  Microsoft Office 365. The Exchange connector connects you to your Exchange deployment and lets you manage mobile devices through the Intune administration console. To learn more about the Exchange connector, see [Mobile device management with Exchange ActiveSync and Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-microsoft-intune).

-   **Intune reports:** Microsoft Intune provides alerts and reports that you can use to help monitor devices, as well as software license status and actions that affect devices (such as wiping a device).  To learn more about reporting, see [Understand Microsoft Intune operations by using reports](/intune-classic/deploy-use/understand-microsoft-intune-operations-by-using-reports).

-   **Protecting company resources:** After you've configured Intune and enrolled your devices, you'll want to make sure that you're protecting devices against data loss and other threats. To learn more about protecting resources, see [Protect apps and data with Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/protect-apps-and-data-with-microsoft-intune).
