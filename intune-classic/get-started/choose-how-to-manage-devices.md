To take advantage of the many features that Intune offers, such as app deployment and control of device settings, your devices must be *managed*. How you manage devices depends on the Intune capabilities you want to use. This topic helps you choose the method that meets your needs.

To manage devices that run iOS, Mac OS X, Android, or Windows Phone, you must *enroll* them.

To manage Windows PCs, you have two choices:

1. Enroll the device **or**
2. Install the *Intune software client*.

## Decide which method to use
Use this decision flow to decide how to get your devices managed.

Enroll Windows PCs to get the most functionality. However, the Intune software client might be more suitable for:

- Windows 7
- Windows software updates and license usage
- Endpoint Protection and Windows Firewall
- Remote assistance to users using the TeamViewer software

For a detailed listing of the management capabilities you'll get with each method, see [Mobile device managem/intune/supported-devices-browserssoft-intune).
For information about the devices and PCs that Intune supports, see [Supported mobile devices and computers](/intune/supported-devices-browsers#intune-supported-devices).
