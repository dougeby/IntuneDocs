- **Shared company-owned devices** - These devices don’t have a single user and usually aren’t configured to access email. Examples include kiosk devices or task-oriented devices users draw from a pool as needed and then return. Recommended enrollment methods depend upon the devices' platform.

- **Dedicated Users** - Company-owned devices that are issued to individual users need to be tracked as company assets while allowing users to access email and data as personal devices. Recommended enrollment methods depend upon the devices' platform.
