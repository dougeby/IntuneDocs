# How Microsoft Intune helps you comply with security and privacy requirements
When you manage devices owned by your company or that your users bring to work, one of your first concerns is your ability to keep those devices and their data secure. You also want to respect the privacy of your users who want the flexibility of bringing their devices to work, but not at the cost of losing control of their own data.

### Croatia
This Zagreb company wanted to provide access to corporate email to its 350 users only on managed smart phones, and to protect that email content, and was able to do that with  [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].
