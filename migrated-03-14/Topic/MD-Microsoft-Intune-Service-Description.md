## <a name="WIT_Cho"></a>Choose the management solution that’s right for you
You can configure [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] in a number of ways to manage and help protect your company's mobile devices and computers (referred to as **devices** in this document).

-   **[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] stand-alone configuration.** Use the web-based administration console in [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] to manage devices in your organization. [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] can be used without any on-premises IT infrastructure, but if you use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] with Active Directory Domain Services, you can use domain user accounts that you manage with Domain Services with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

-   **[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] with System Center Configuration Manager.** Use the [!INCLUDE[cm5short](../Token/cm5short_md.md)] management console to manage computers and mobile devices in your enterprise. This configuration can help you to manage all of your organization’s devices through a single console, the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../Token/cmshort_md.md)] Admin Console. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../Token/cmshort_md.md)] supports very large numbers of mobile devices, servers and computers. For more information, see [How to Manage Mobile Devices by Using Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=271118) in the [Documentation Library for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/33b7b516-2d32-4e55-bd79-ed7d3ea37162).
