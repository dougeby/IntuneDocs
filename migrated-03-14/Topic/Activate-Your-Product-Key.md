# Activate Your Product Key
You can use a product key to redeem a subscription or add users to an existing subscription. A product key is a unique 25-character alpha-numeric code that is required to redeem a subscription, access online services, or download software. You can purchase product keys from a Microsoft partner or reseller.

## Redeem your product key
To redeem your product key, enter the 25-character code.

-   If you are activating a [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] product key, go [here](https://account.manage.microsoft.com/commerce/productkeystart.aspx).

-   If you are activating an Enterprise Mobility Suite product key, go [here](http://www.microsoft.com/ems/open).

> [!NOTE]
> If you lose your product key, contact the partner or reseller that you purchased it from.
