# Run state
Now that your [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] system is operational, and you depend on it for business-critical functions and for secure device usage, maintain a robust system.

## Why is this important?
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] provides a dashboard that enables you to monitor the health of your managed devices, including Endpoint Protection status and warnings. You should have organizational practices in place to react to [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] alerts.

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] is frequently updated with new features and functionality. It's important that the you pay close attention to notices regarding these changes.
Communicating and training for updates, establishing a plan for new hires and ensuring your help desk has the most current troubleshooting resources are all key to maximizing the rewards of your investment.
Begin by reviewing the discovery questions to help scope and define your ongoing operational plan.

## Discovery questions
Discuss these questions with your project team to help scope your project details, uncover potential risks, and define actionable tasks which can be documented in the  Rollout Planning Guide and Project Plan.

-   Who makes up your  run-state team?

-   How will you report to key stakeholders?

-   Who will be responsible for update awareness?

## Focus area goals
Review this section for guidance on focus-area activities for this stated phase of your rollout.

### Planning
Ensure your rollout is set up for long-term success and sustained adoption.

### Help desk
During the run-state phase, inform your help desk of service updates, or  when issues arise, to ensure they are prepared to address questions from end-users. Stay familiar with Microsoft content and community resources to be able to solve issues as they arise.

### Awareness
Awareness does not stop once your rollout is complete. If a service update or changes to an operating system will affect the user experience, communicate that effect to the users promptly. New users will have to be educated about the corporate device management approach.

### Training
As new features are enabled ensure your training materials are updated.

### Operations
Monitor your [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] console for alerts and user or device issues, and to ensure that polices and application distribution are performing according to your organizational plan.

## Get started checklist
Here is a list of steps to get you started with the **Run state** phase.

-   Ensure that your monitoring procedures are in place.

-   Be prepared to react to important alerts.

-   All admins are aware of feature and functionality updates

-   Help desk is aware of changes to wit_nextref, including changes related to the functionality of devices of varying operating systems.

## Common challenges
Here are some  challenges that you may encounter in the **Run state** phase.

-   **Challenge:** Admins know that their environment needs to be monitored regularly. However, they are not experienced with the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] consoles.

    **Mitigation:** Invest in quality training. Admins should become intimately familiar with the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] consoles, so that they will be able to update policies, dstribute software, and diagnose and troubleshoot issues with higher confidence.

-   **Challenge:** Users encounter issues with enrollment and with app installation.

    **Mitigation:** Prepare your help desk with troubleshooting content that can enable quick resolution of common problems.
