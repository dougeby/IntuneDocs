-   Information you provide or upload to the Services may be stored outside of the country in which you reside.

**Your use of any Service administered through this site is governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement(s) under which you purchased the Service. You can obtain a copy of your agreement(s) by contacting [Intune Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242283).**

**If Microsoft believes that unauthorized or improper use is being made of the Service, it may, without notice and at its sole discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate, including blocking messages from a particular internet domain, mail server or IP address. Violation of this Policy can lead to termination of a customer's account.**

**Microsoft reserves the right to amend or change the Policy of any service at any time without notice. We encourage you to periodically review these guidelines to ensure you are in compliance.**

**Nothing in this policy is intended to grant any rights in the Service. Failure to enforce this Policy in every instance does not amount to a waiver of Microsoft's rights.**
