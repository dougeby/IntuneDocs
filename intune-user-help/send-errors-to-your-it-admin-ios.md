# Send errors to your company support for issues with your iOS device

If you get errors on your iOS device while using the Company Portal app, you can send information to help your company support troubleshoot the problem. You can send error information in different ways:

-   On error alert messages, tap **Report**.

-   On the **About** screen of the Company Portal app, tap **Send Diagnostic Report**.

-   In the Company Portal app, shake your device, then tap **Send Diagnostic Report** when the diagnostics alert appears. If the alert doesn’t appear when you shake the device, open **Settings** > **Company Portal**, and make sure that the **Shake Gesture** option is on.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
