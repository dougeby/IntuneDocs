# Enroll your Windows 10 device in Intune

  > [!NOTE]
  > Windows 10 works across all types of devices. Whether you're using a desktop, phone, or tablet, the steps you follow are the same - even if they look slightly different from the images on this page.

1.  Go to **Start**.

  - If you are on a **Windows 10 desktop** device, go to the **Start menu**.
  - If you are on a **Windows 10 Mobile** device, go to the **Start screen**, then swipe to the **All Apps** list.

2. Open the Windows **Settings** app by searching for "settings" in the search bar.

3. Select **Accounts**.

4. Select **Your account**.

5. Select **Add a work or school account**.

6. Sign in with your work or school credentials.

Still can't access your work or school email, files, or other data? Try to fix your access by [troubleshooting issues with your account](troubleshoot-your-windows-10-device-windows.md#troubleshooting-steps-to-follow-if-you-see-your-account). If it still doesn't work, you'll need to contact your IT administrator for further help.

An easy way to get help from your IT administrator is through the contact information available in the Company Portal app, which also lets you find and download recommended and required apps for your daily work. It's possible that you already have the Company Portal app installed on your device. A quick way to check is to look for __Company Portal__ in your __All apps__ list.

If you don't see the Company Portal in your list of apps, follow these steps to install it.

1. Select **Start** > **Store**.

2. Select **Search**, and then type **company portal**.

3. In the list of results, select **Company Portal** > **Install**.

4. Select either **Install** or **Free**. There is no difference between these two options for you; the choice that is shown depends on how your organization set up the Company Portal app.
