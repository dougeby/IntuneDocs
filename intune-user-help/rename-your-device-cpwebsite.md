# Rename your device from the Company Portal website

You may decide that you want to rename your device to make it easier to identify. You can do this from the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com). The Company Portal website is a web page that you can use to manage computers and devices that you have enrolled into management with your IT department.

To rename your device:

1.	On the [Company Portal website](http://portal.manage.microsoft.com), tap the __menu__ button ![A small image of the menu button, three horizontal bars stacked in parallel.](/Intune/whats-new/media/CP_hamburger_menu.png), then select __My Devices__.

2. On the __My Devices__ page, select the name of the device you want to rename.

3.	The device will open in a popup window. Tap the **Rename** button.

4.  In the box where your device's name appears, type a new name for your device, and then tap the **Rename** button. Your device now appears with the new name.
