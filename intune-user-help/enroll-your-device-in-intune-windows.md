# Enroll your Windows device in Intune

If your company or school uses Microsoft Intune, you can enroll your Windows device to get access to company email, files, and other resources. When you enroll your devices, your organization can keep corporate data secure. To learn more about enrollment, see [What happens if you install the Company Portal app and enroll your device in Intune?](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-windows.md) and [What your company support can and can't see on your device](what-info-can-your-company-see-when-you-enroll-your-device-in-intune.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You must access the Company Portal website through Microsoft Edge to view Windows apps. Other browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer do not support this type of filtering.
