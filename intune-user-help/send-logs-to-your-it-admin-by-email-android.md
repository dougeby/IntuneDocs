# Email logs to your company support

Sometimes you may experience an error while you're using the Company Portal app on your Android device. When this occurs, you can email details about the error to your company's support person. These details will provide the context needed to troubleshoot the problem for you.  

Error details are kept on your device in a special document called a _diagnostic log_. When you upload the logs to the Company Portal app, they're first sent to the Microsoft developers that work on the app. They use the logs to improve the app's functionality and prevent future errors. An incident ID for your specific error is then provided to you to share with your company support person, for use in Microsoft Support cases.

> [!Note]
> To make it easier for your company support to find the cause of the problem, turn on _verbose logging_. Verbose logging records all details about an error and includes these details in the report. Find out how to [turn on verbose logging here](use-verbose-logging-to-help-your-it-administrator-fix-device-issues-android.md).  

To email logs to your company support:

1.  Open the Company Portal app.

2.  Tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Email Support**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> **Menu** could be a software button or a hardware button, depending on which Android device you have.

3.  Tap **Send Email & Upload Logs**.
4.  After the upload is complete, tap your email app. An email message will open with the incident ID pre-populated in the subject field. In the body of the email, describe the problem that you encountered.
