# You need to turn off USB debugging

_USB debugging_ is a mode that lets Android devices communicate to computers with the purpose of making Android apps easier for developers. It allows certain access to specialized areas of the phone that most people don't need to interact with regularly. While useful, having this access turned on can place your device at additional risk of information being compromised when it is connected to a computer. Your company support has required this setting to be turned off to better protect the corporate data on your device.

You can turn off USB debugging by going to **Settings** > **Developer options**, and turn off **USB debugging**.

After you turn off **USB debugging**, wait a few minutes, then you should be able to to use your Android device to access company or school data as usual.
