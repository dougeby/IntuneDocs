# Sync your iOS device manually

Sometimes an app may take too long to download from the Company Portal. If this happens to you, you can try to manually sync your device. This means that you are telling your device to try again to get the information it may be struggling to download.

1. Open the Company Portal app.

2. In the **My Devices** section, choose the device that you are currently using. This is the leftmost device tile - it also has a checkmark on it.

3. Tap the **Sync** button at the bottom right of the screen.

A loading bar will appear on the screen and will load until the sync is finished.
