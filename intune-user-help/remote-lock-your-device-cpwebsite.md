# Remotely lock your device from the Company Portal website

Accidents happen, and sometimes devices can go missing. If your device has been lost or stolen, the first worry you might have is that the information on it could be accessed by anyone, wherever your device is.

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](includes/end-user-password-guidance.md)]

To be safe, you can lock it by using the Remote Lock option on the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog). Remote Lock works for:

* Android
* iOS
* macOS
* Windows 10
* Windows 10 Mobile (if the device already had a passcode set)
* Windows Phone 8.1 (if the device already had a passcode set)

## To use Remote Lock to lock your device

1.	On the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog), tap the __menu__ button, then select __My Devices__.

2. On the __My Devices__ page, select the name of the device you want to lock.

3.	The device will open in a popup window. Tap the **Remote Lock** button.

	![All options for a selected device on the Company Portal website, including Rename, Remove, Reset Device, Reset Passcode, and Remote Lock. ](./media/iwp-screen-with-all-options.png)

4.	A notice will appear to let you know that you are about to lock your device. Tap **Remote Lock**, and the Company Portal website will try to lock your device.

	Once you select **Remote Lock**, a “Remote lock pending” message will appear.  When Remote Lock succeeds, the status changes to “Remote lock successful.”

	The Remote Lock status displays in three places:

	* The notifications area of the website.
	* The **Details** page for the device.
	* The tile that shows the device name on the **My Devices** section of the page.

> [!Note]
> If you see a “Remote Lock failed” notification, wait a few minutes, and try to lock your device again. After you begin to retry, the status will change back to “Remote lock pending.” If the retry doesn't work, you'll need to reach out to your company support.

If you find your device and want to unlock it after using Remote Lock, just enter your passcode.
