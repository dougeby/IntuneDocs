# Turn off Microsoft usage data collection

Microsoft automatically collects certain data about our products and services. We do this to improve the reliability and performance of our products, including the Company Portal app. Even though this data is anonymized, some users may not feel comfortable with this collection. Your company support does not have control over the collection of this data, and they cannot change your selection for the setting.

If you wish to turn off the collection of that data on your Android device, open the **Usage Data** setting in the Company Portal app.

Still need help? Contact your company support. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
