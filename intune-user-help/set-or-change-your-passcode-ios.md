# Set or change your passcode

If your iOS device doesn't comply with your company support's passcode policy, a message appears that briefly describes the issue and explains what you need to do to make your passcode meet the requirements.

Your company support can set more than one passcode requirement. For example, the passcode might have to contain a certain number of characters, and it might need to have a mix of numbers, letters, and characters. Because more than one requirement might be set, these instructions can explain only how to set or change your passcode. They don't explain every possible combination of requirements. These passcodes are used, for example, to access your device from the lock screen.

If you have trouble setting a passcode that meets the passcode requirements, contact your company support for help.

## Set your passcode

1. Tap **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**.
2. On the **Touch ID & Passcode** menu, tap **Turn Passcode On**.
3. Enter a new passcode that meets your company support's requirements, and then enter it again to verify it.

## Change your passcode

1. Tap **Settings** > **Touch ID & Passcode**.
2. Enter your passcode. The **Touch ID & Passcode** menu opens.
2. Tap **Change Passcode** and enter your old password.
3. Enter a new passcode that meets your company support's requirements, and then enter it again to verify it.
