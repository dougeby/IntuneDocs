Your company support detected that you are using a jailbroken device. "Jailbroken" means that the device has been changed to enable unrestricted access to certain critical files, which can compromise security and might be a threat to your company resources.

When this happens, your device can no longer access company resources and you must contact your company support for help. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com#HelpDeskDialog).
