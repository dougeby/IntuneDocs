# Reset your device from the Company Portal website

Learn how to reset a used, lost, or stolen device to factory default settings from the Company Portal website.  

After you reset a device, it no longer appears in the Company Portal. Previously existing apps and files are erased and the device is restored to its factory default settings.

> [!Note]
> You can also perform the following steps from another device that you've enrolled. Open the Company Portal app on that device and go through similar steps to complete the reset.  

1. Open the Company Portal website and select the __Menu__ button > __Devices__.  

2. Select the device you want to reset.

3. Select **Reset**. If the reset option isn't visible at the top of your page, select **More (…)** > **Reset**.
