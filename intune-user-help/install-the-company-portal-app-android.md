# Install the Company Portal app for Android

The Company Portal is an app that gives you access to your company or school apps, email, and Internet connections. This app helps you keep both your organization's information safe by keeping your device secure - for example, by keeping company apps up to date, or making sure your device locks itself after a certain amount of time. The Company Portal app is able to do this by helping you to [enroll your device in Microsoft Intune](what-happens-if-you-install-the-company-portal-app-and-enroll-your-device-in-intune-android.md).

1.  Tap **Home** > **Play Store**.

2.  In the **Search** box, type **intune company portal**.

3.  Tap **Intune Company Portal**.

5.  Tap **ACCEPT**.

After you download the Company Portal app, you will likely want to [enroll your device in Intune](enroll-your-device-in-Intune-android.md) to get full access to your work information. You can also [sign in using another device](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal#signing-in-from-another-device).
