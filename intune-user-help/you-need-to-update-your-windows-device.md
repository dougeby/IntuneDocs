For mobile devices running Windows, update your device by navigating to **Settings** > **phone update** > **check for updates**.

For computers running Windows, search for **operating system** and follow the prompts to identify which version of Windows you're running.

> [!Note]
> To update computers that have operating systems earlier than Windows 8.1, search for **Windows updates**.

For Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, type __Windows version__ into the __search bar__. Under __Can I help?__, select __windows version__. The version number will appear. This number will look something like __10.0.14393.447__.
